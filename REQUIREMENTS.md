## Requirements for Muledump

### CORS Browser Extension

In order to get around browser restrictions when attempting to contact Deca servers, Muledump presently needs a browser extension to make its requests work.

Do not forget the astrisk at the end of the url in the settings!

#### Google Chrome (recommended)
- Requires the extension **[Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)**
- In the CORS settings clear any existing Intercepted URLs and add: ```https://realmofthemadgodhrd.appspot.com/*```

#### Firefox
- Requires the extension **[CORS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/)**
- When you wish to run Muledump, turn on this extension as described [here](https://github.com/spenibus/cors-everywhere-firefox-addon/blob/master/README.md).

#### Opera
