# White Bag Tracker

Welcome to the White Bag Tracker! This tool is designed to let you keep track of your white bags with several different ways to go about the task.

In the Totals mode, the White Bag Tracker shows your owned white bags and a quantity. You can change the quantity if desired to set the data however you want.

In the Owned mode, the White Bag Tracker shows your owned skins without the quantity.

#### Notice

Importing white bag counts should be done with Custom Character Sorting Lists turned off unless you want to import the white bag data from just those characters.
