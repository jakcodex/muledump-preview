## Totals Settings Manager

The Totals Settings Manager is a simple tool to allow you to manage the bulkier side of totals.

Many of these new features require that you be running Muledump with SetupTools. This means you are not using an accounts.js file. You can read more about this at <a href="https://github.com/jakcodex/muledump/wiki/Totals-Management" target="blank">Totals Management</a> in the wiki.

### Configuration Sets

Configuration sets allow you to create custom totals configurations which you can quickly switch between. Each list has its own item and account filters as well as its own settings for all available totals options.

### Item Sorting

Click and drag item groups to sort their display order.

Shift+Click to toggle the item group's enabled status (enabled is highlighted).

Double Click to open the item group's subsorting menu to sort items in each group.

### Account Filter Members

When the Account Filter is active only accounts listed in the filter are displayed in totals. Shift+Click the account to remove it. Removing all accounts disabled the filter.

### Permanently Hidden Items

Items in Muledump totals display can be permanently hidden by Shift+Clicking it in the display. All hidden items can be seen here and selectively removed with another Shift+Click.
