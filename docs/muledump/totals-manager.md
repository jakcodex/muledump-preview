## <a href="#" id="tsm"></a>Totals Settings Manager

The Totals Settings Manager is a simple tool to allow you to manage the bulkier side of totals.

Many of these new features require that you be running Muledump SetupTools. This means you are not using an accounts.js file.

You can read a general overview about this at <a href="https://github.com/jakcodex/muledump/wiki/Totals" target="blank">Muledump Totals</a> in the wiki.

### Configuration Sets

Configuration sets allow you to create custom totals configurations that you can quickly switch between. Each list has its own item and account filters as well as its own settings for all available totals options.

Configuration sets that are favorited will appear in the Favorite Filters dropdown menu in the Totals Menu.

The Default configuration set does not save any changes made to it.

### Item Group Sorting

Click and drag item groups to sort their display order.

Shift+Click to toggle the item group's enabled status (enabled is highlighted).

Double Click to open the item group's subsorting menu to view and sort items in each group.

This feature is only used when Sorting Mode is set to Standard.

### Account Filter Members
