# Updating Renders

Renders is responsible for showing you items, skins, and dyes. They can be updated fairly frequently in game.

When an update is available, rather than downloading all of Jakcodex/Muledump again, you can instead just update the specified files.

Save them over the existing files in your Muledump installation and refresh the page to apply.
