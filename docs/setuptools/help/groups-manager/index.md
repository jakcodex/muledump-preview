# Groups Manager

The Groups Manager is a utility to allow you to create custom account profiles for Muledump. 

With Groups Manager you can create one or more group to organize all of your mules. Accounts can belong to multiple groups. Groups can be enabled or disabled.

When groups are enabled, upon loading Muledump the active accounts list is built from the enabled groups list. 

### Group Merge Modes
In parallel mode, Groups Manager will sort group members to the final list using their original group position.

In serial mode, Groups Manager will create a single-file ordered list of groups in order of priority group-by-group.
