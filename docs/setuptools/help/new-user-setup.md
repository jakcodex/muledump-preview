#### No Errors

If there were no errors then you should be all set! You should download a backup of your configuration in case you ever need to restore.

You can manage backups in the [Backup Manager](backups-manager/backups.md).

#### Oops, there was a problem.

If no valid accounts were detected then this error will be displayed. Account emails and IDs must be valid in order to be saved.
