# Local Storage Compression Utility

When you turn <a href="../../muledump/storage-compression.md" class="drawhelp inner nostyle">Storage Compression</a> on or off the existing local storage data is left as-is. Data will be compressed or decompressed the next time Muledump changes it.

The Compression Utility will convert all storage to match the current settings. This is especially useful if you've just enabled Storage Compression and need to immediately compress all data.

### Analyze

Scans local storage and reports how many files need to be converted.

### Synchronize

Converts all out-of-sync storage with current settings.
