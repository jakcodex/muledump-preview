# Custom Character Sorting Lists

On a per-account level the character sorting option being set to custom allows you to create customized lists which will only show the characters specified.

You can create as many named lists as you would like. Switching between lists is fast and easy.

## Usage

Click the + next to the reload icon for the account you wish to modify.

If any lists exist for this account, a drop down menu will be displayed first. Selecting lists will update the two fields below.

To create a named list first type the name into the 'List Name to Edit' box. Then add a comma-separated list of character ids. Example: 33, 199, 449, 300, 200

Saving a list whose name doesn't exist creates a new list.

Saving a list whose name already exist overwrites the list.

Selecting a list and giving it a new name creates a new list.

Deleting a list will reset the active list to the first list.

Saving a list sets it as the active list.
